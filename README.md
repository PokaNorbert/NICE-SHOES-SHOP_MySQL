## Database Project for **Nice-Shoes Shop**
The scope of this project is to use all the SQL knowledge gained throught the Software Testing course and apply them in practice.

**Application** under test: Nice-Shoes Shop

**Tools** used: MySQL Workbench

**Database description:** The online shoe store aims to sell exclusively shoes for men and women, excluding clothing and other clothing items. All products can be ordered at any time using the website that is made available to customers. However, this does not guarantee that orders will be processed immediately, given the fact that it is an online store at the beginning of its journey with reduced staff.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, I realized that I like working with databases. With the help of this project, I was able to realize what knowledge I have managed to acquire so far in working with databases. 

In this regard, I will publish new projects or solved exercises related to working with databases in the future. In order to develop my work skills with databases, it is necessary to participate in similar projects that belong to other people or groups of people or even work within a company (in this case, I turn my engines to maximum speed to be able to learn as quickly as possible).
